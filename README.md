Not documented yet! This development is related on this conversation: [Twitter Link](https://twitter.com/k1r0s/status/919271946109554694) and this issue [GH preact issue](https://github.com/developit/preact/issues/909#issuecomment-336656084)

This decorator allows to easily style Preact components through adding a scoped stylesheet inside that component and defined styles only get applied to it and its descendants.

Basically it allows to style in preact like Angular or [Vue does by adding a scoped stylesheet](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/features/scoped-css.html)
